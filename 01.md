1. NPM act as a repo to host the package that is uploaded by devs and these packages are low-level, fully optimized and tested so user do not have to rewrite from scratch.

2. NPM contains the minified Archived tar.gz file of packages not the code of packages.

3. NPM provide the cli to manage the packages on dev machine.

4. internally npm use javascript it cannot work without a js env and nodejs provide the js env that why we need nodejs to use npm.

5. You can get the nodejs a js runtime from
 following link - https://nodejs.org/

 6. After the install we can check the version 
 by executing "npm -v" in shell also for nodejs by executing "node -v" .

 7. We can install and use multiple versions of node on a single machine this is helpful when we are working on 
 legecy code base and also on a new project.
 sometimes the node packages can be system binary which has to be compiled using nodejs env (node-gyp) these binary can be node version dependent.


 8. We can get multipal version of node by using "nvm" in any OS but package "n" is recommanded to be used on UNIX based os, by executing "sudo npm i -g n" we can install it globally and get latest node by executing "sudo n latest" and whenever our node is updated npm is also updated
